# `simple-src-docs`

simple-src-docs is tool to facilitate generating documentation from your source files

```
Extracts doc strings into markdown files

Walks through all files in `<SOURCE>` and searches for comments. With comments, looks for
`@file [file]` on its own line and if present the contents of the comment are appended to the
specified file path. The file and its directories are created at the given `<DEST>`.
Optionally, you can provide `@order [num]` on its own line to influence the ordering of the
comment content. Content is sorted from the lowest to the highest `order`, breaking ties by
pre-sorted ordering. Additional `@` prefixed tags will be excluded from the output. All text
on preceding lines is included as part of the tag until an empty line or a new tag is
encountered. The additional tags don't do anything unless you define an appropriate
configuration template (See README.md for details). You can configure what is considered a
comment for a given file extension in your config file.

Usage: simple-src-docs [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]...

Arguments:
  [SOURCE]...
          the source directories or files where comments will be extracted from

Options:
  -d, --dest <DEST>
          root directory where markdown files are generated

          [default: .]

  -v, --verbose
          if set, show detailed messages about document processing

      --config <CONFIG>
          location of file used to further configure simple-src-docs (see README.md), defaults
          to `<DEST>/.simple-src-docs.config.toml

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

The config file is a TOML file that can be used to configure how comments are identified and define templates to transform documentation blocks based on tags (`@` prefixed identifiers followed by a line of text). It has the following specification:

- `header`: must contain a `version` string that is [semver](https://semver.org/) compatible with 0.2. The version specified here is 0.2.1.
- `template`: Object used to transform docs with a given set of tags. There are two fields:
   - `foreach`: an array of templates that are applied to each document block. All fields can be specified as [mustache template](https://mustache.github.io/) strings. Each mustache field in the template corresponds to one of the tags from the original document block. In addition the field `__body__` can be used to include the remaining text from a comment block.
        - `tags`: an array of strings. This template will apply to any document block where all the specified tags are present.
        - `file`: the file to store output in
        - `order`: (optional) the order of this template output relative to other document
          blocks. Defaults to 0.
        - `output`: the resulting text output to write to the file
   - `all`: an array of templates that are applied across to a list of all document blocks. All fields can be specified as [mustache template](https://mustache.github.io/) strings. There is a single mustache variable named `items`, an array whose items correspond to the tags and the `__body__` in the original document block. This includes the same fields as `foreach`:
        - `tags`: an array of strings. This template will apply to any document block where all the specified tags are present.
        - `file`: the file to store output in
        - `order`: the order of this template output relative to other document blocks
        - `output`: the resulting text output to write to the file
- `comment`: defines how comments are found in a given type of file
   - `extension`: a [glob](https://github.com/olson-sean-k/wax/blob/master/README.md#patterns) expression describing what files this comment type describe, which will be prefixed with `(?i)`, making it case insensitive.
   - `start`: the starting regular expression for a multi-line comment
   - `each_line`: The prefix that must be present (for single-line comments) and that can be present for multi-line comments. The first capture group must contain the contents of the comment
   - `end`: The the ending regular expression for a multi-line-comment

Note that default comment settings are defined by simple-src-docs, the use the multi-line
comments for a language, where possible, and single line comments otherwise.

Example config file

```toml

[[template.all]]
tags = ["bindingField"]

## Roadmap

- support filtering via the config file / command line args
- implement a "watch" mode version of the service (or use npm extension to do this for us
  in master key)
